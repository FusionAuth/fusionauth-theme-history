# Fusionauth Theme History

Here you can compare different versions of the default, stock FusionAuth theme.

This can be useful when there is a new release and you have customized the FusionAuth theme. FusionAuth provides default values for new theme pages, but reviewing this repository can help you prepare and also notice smaller changes, such as new sections or parameters.

* Click the `tags` tab.
* Choose the earlier version you are interested in comparing.
* Click the `compare` button.
* Click the `tags` tab.
